You have two numbers and you need to add them together.
You're in luck! The `sum` package can help you
get this done.

Download the code from this GitHub repository and place
the `sum/` folder in the same directory as your
Python script:

    your_project/
    │
    ├── sum/
    │   ├── __init__.py
    │   └── sum.py
    │
    └── your_script.py

Inside of `your_script.py` you can now import the
 function from the `sum.sum` module.
